The suit covers the entire body, including the head, and is designed to protect against hazardous materials. Additionally, the person is equipped with a backpack-style device, which appears to be a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). This device provides clean air by filtering out contaminants and is connected to a flexible hose that extends to the suit's hood, ensuring the wearer can breathe safely in potentially hazardous environments.</div>
